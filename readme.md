#Reponsive Bootstrap Navbar

This is a code snipett I put together to demostrate a simple Responsive Nav with a collaspable Menu for small screens.

Resize your browser t a smaller size to find the breakpoint and notice the Menu become a hamburger icon suitable for mobile devices and small screens.

This uses the Bootstrap 3.2.0 CDN's and standard Bootstrap classes.
